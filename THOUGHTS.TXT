- LOOP THROUGH LIST, EACH LOOP IS A WORKER
-- GO THROUGH EACH WORKERS BOOKINGS LIST
--- CHECK WHICH DATES ARE MISSING?
--- SAVING EVERY DATE WONT WORK SINCE WE NEED THE ARRAY TO BE THE SAME AS THE OTHER PROPERTIES
--- SAVE AN ARRAY OF ALL DATES, USE FIND TO SEARCH EACH DATE IN THE BOOKINGS LIST
---- IF IT DOES EXIST, IGNORE, IF IT DOESNT PUSH NEW ENTRY TO WORKER'S BOOKINGS

SORT THE BOOKINGS ARRAY ON DATE
